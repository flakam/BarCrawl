    <h2>Welcome to Crawlr!</h2>
    <p>The app that lets you drink on YOUR terms.</p>
    <p>
        Bar crawls are fun, right? Of course. But we think they would be even more fun if they were a little more <br />
        spontaneous. Crawlr gives you the options: Create a personal bar crawl with just you and your mates, or join an <br />
        existing one and meet up with fellow bar hoppers.
